# Postgraduate-Placement-Predictor

This data set consists of Placement data of students. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students. Task is to build a model to predict if a student gets placed or not.

For this purpose I  applied various classification algorithms but, finally used K Nearest neighbour algorithm which gives 87.6% accuracy. More fine tuning can be done. But the aim here was to build an End-to-End project. So, I went ahead with this result.

All the files required for deployment are attached to this repo. Tools and app which I have used are:

		1) Python (PlacementPredictor) -> Model Building
		2) Pywebio & Flask (app.py)-> Web Framework 
		3) Heroku (Procfile & requirements.txt) -> Model Deployment
